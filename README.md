Learn to use Camera

16 is width and 9 is height in ratio
* Common aspect ratios are 16:9 (widescreen) and 4:3 (standard).
When to use:
* 16:9: Best for wide-screen displays like TVs, YouTube, or modern monitors.
* 4:3: Captures more vertical content, good for action shots where you want a taller frame.


Exposure
* What it is: Exposure determines how bright or dark your image or video appears. It is controlled by three elements:
    * ISO: The camera’s sensitivity to light. Higher ISO = brighter image, but too high can introduce noise (graininess).
* Low ISO (100-200): Less sensitive, better for bright conditions.
* High ISO (800+): More sensitive, better for low light but can add grain or noise.
    * Shutter Speed: How long the camera's sensor is exposed to light. Slower speed = brighter but may blur fast motion; faster speed = sharper but darker.
    * Aperture: Determines how much light enters through the lens (usually fixed on action cameras).
* When to adjust:
    * Use a higher exposure in low light and a lower exposure in bright environments like sunny beaches.
Fast Shutter Speed (e.g., 1/1000s): Freezes motion but darker image.
Slow Shutter Speed (e.g., 1/30s): Brighter image but may blur fast motion.



Frame Rate (FPS - Frames Per Second)
* What it is: How many frames the camera captures per second.
    * Common rates: 30fps, 60fps, 120fps, or higher.
* When to use:
    * 30fps: Standard for most videos (good for slower motion or talking scenes).
    * 60fps or higher: Great for smoother videos or fast-paced action (e.g., sports, slow motion).
    * Common values: 24fps (cinematic), 30fps (standard), 60fps (smooth), 120fps or higher (slow motion).
* Why it matters: Higher frame rates capture smoother motion but can use more storage space.


Resolution
* What it is: The number of pixels in your video, affecting sharpness and clarity.
    * Common resolutions: 1080p (Full HD), 4K, 2.7K.
* When to use:
    * 1080p: Good balance of quality and storage.
    * 4K: Best for sharp, detailed videos (requires more storage and processing power).
* Why it matters: Higher resolution gives more detail but uses more battery and storage.



Field of View (FOV)
* What it is: Determines how wide the camera captures the scene.
    * Modes: Wide, Linear, Narrow.
* When to use:
    * Wide: Captures more surroundings, great for action shots (but may distort edges).
    * Linear or Narrow: Removes distortion, better for regular videos or vlogs.
* Why it matters: FOV affects how immersive or cinematic your video looks.


White Balance
* What it is: Adjusts the color tones in your video to make them look natural under different lighting conditions.
    * Example: Indoor light looks yellow; white balance corrects this.
* When to use:
    * Set it manually for consistent results (e.g., "Sunny" for outdoors, "Incandescent" for indoor lighting).
    * Many cameras also have an "Auto" mode.


Stabilization
* What it is: Reduces shakiness in your videos using software (EIS - electronic image stabilization) or hardware (gimbal or OIS).
* When to use:
    * Always turn stabilization on when recording fast-paced or handheld footage.


Bitrate
* What it is: Bitrate refers to the amount of data your camera processes per second in a video. Measured in Mbps (megabits per second).
* Why it matters:
    * Higher bitrate = better video quality (more details retained).
    * Lower bitrate = smaller file size but reduced quality.
* When to use:
    * Use high bitrate for 4K or cinematic footage.
    * Use lower bitrate for casual videos to save storage.


Color Profiles (Flat, Vivid, Standard, etc.)
* What it is: Determines how the camera processes colors and contrast in your footage.
    * Flat/Log Profile: Low contrast and saturation, good for post-editing.
    * Vivid Profile: Boosts colors and contrast, ready for sharing without editing.
* When to use:
    * Use Flat if you plan to edit your footage later.
    * Use Vivid/Standard for quick, vibrant results
    * 

//Saturated - meaning hold as much water and noise as can be absorbed; thoroughly soaked
Color saturation is a measure of how intense, pure, or vivid a color appears. In other words, it's how "pure" a color is. 

How it's used in photography
A photo with high saturation has bright and vivid colors, while a photo with low saturation has more subdued colors. 


Dynamic Range
* What it is: The range of light the camera can capture between the darkest shadows and the brightest highlights.
* Why it matters: Cameras with higher dynamic range (HDR) preserve more detail in both bright and dark areas.
* When to use:
    * HDR mode is great for high-contrast scenes (e.g., sunny days, backlit subjects).


Sharpness
* What it is: A setting that determines how much fine detail is emphasized in your footage.
* When to use:
    * High sharpness: Best for action videos with lots of detail.
    * Low sharpness: Use when you plan to edit and add sharpness later.
* Tip: Over-sharpening can make footage look unnatural.


Night Mode / Low-Light Performance
* What it is: Settings optimized for shooting in dark environments.
    * Low-light modes typically use slower shutter speeds or higher ISO.
* When to use:
    * Use night mode or lower frame rates (e.g., 24fps) in dark settings to improve brightness.


//interval - amount of time between each shot
//time lapse video - video created from still images captured using interval shooting
Interval Shooting / Time-Lapse
* What it is: A feature where the camera takes a photo or frame at set intervals to create time-lapse videos.
* Why it matters:
    * Great for capturing long processes like sunsets, city traffic, or clouds.
* Tip: Use a stable mount or tripod for best results.


Gyroscope and Horizon Leveling
* What it is: Features that keep your footage level even when the camera tilts.
    * Gyroscopes detect motion to stabilize video.
    * Horizon leveling ensures the horizon stays straight.
* Why it matters: Makes footage look smooth and professional, especially for extreme sports.

File Formats (JPEG, RAW, MP4, etc.)
* What it is: Determines how your footage or images are stored.
    * RAW: More data for detailed editing (larger files).
    * JPEG/MP4: Compressed formats for easy sharing and storage.
* When to use:
    * RAW for professional editing; MP4 for everyday use.


Depth of Field (DoF)
* What it is: The range of focus in a shot, from foreground to background.
    * Shallow DoF: Only the subject is in focus; background is blurry (cinematic effect).
    * Deep DoF: Everything in the frame is in focus.
* Why it matters: Helps draw attention to the subject or provide context.
